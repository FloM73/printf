# printf
This is a main with some flags for the printf project (Version July 2021 with bonus).

- in PURPLE = your output

- in WHITE = the official printf

Hope it can help someone. The Moulinette graded me 125% but of course there is no warranty that all the tests are covered in this file.

Notice to the %p with Null pointer : be careful on MAC the output should be something like "0x0" but Windows output is "(nil)". Since I'm on Windows I've trixed a little bit the Null-pointers output. Take care to adjust it to your own environnement.
